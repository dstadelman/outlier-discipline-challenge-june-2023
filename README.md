Company / Trade Conferences as Tradable Events

The Outlier Discipline Challenge for June 2023 takes place everyday in June. 

This is constitutes the mental side of the discipline challenge that I will work on for about three minutes a day.

I am going to research the possibility of company and trade conferences as tradeable events, starting with **AAPL and the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)**.

Hypothesis: 

* Before the event 
   * upwards skewed abnormal returns
   * implied volatilty expands
* After the event
   * implied volatility contracts

## 1 June 2023

* Started project and wrote hypothesis for the experiment
* Found [list of dates of WWDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference)
